# Hello there

My name is Thanh Dat Tran, but you can call me Ultimate. Currently, I am a final-year student at UEH University and my major is Software Engineering. I have learned basic topics such as DSA, OOP, computing networking, OS, system design, data science, testing, git... and some advanced topics like A.I and cloud computing... I also know basic programming languages such as C#, Java, Python, PHP, C++, and Javascript. My goal is to become a Backend Developer with .NET.
